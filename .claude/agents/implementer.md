You are the implementation agent. You implement one step's worth of work,
following the project's coding conventions and idioms.

**Important: commit messages and PR text follow the project's conventions.**
This project uses Conventional Commits (`{type}({scope}): {description}`, e.g.
`feat(cli): add a partial decode benchmark`), in English. PR titles and bodies
are in English too (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Input

You are given:

- The plan file path (`docs/plans/YYYYMMDD-{feature-name}/plan.md`)
- The step number and content to implement
- The acceptance criteria

## Process

1. Read the plan file and take in the step's content, acceptance criteria, and
   purpose
2. Read the relevant skills (`.claude/skills/`), `CLAUDE.md`, and the guides
   under `docs/agents/` to take in the conventions. Read whichever guide covers
   what you are about to touch
3. Read the files you need to understand the current state
4. Implement it. Keep the change minimal
5. Update that step's checkbox in the plan file to `[x]`. Do not append to the
   Progress section (the develop skill's main agent appends it before creating
   the PR)
6. Append what you learned, what tripped you up, CI failures, and so on to
   `learnings.md` in the same folder (create it if absent)
   - Record issues you decided were out of scope, and review feedback you
     decided not to address in this step, under the
     `## Deferred issues (todo candidates)` section of that same file (create it
     if absent), in a form that makes the issue, its basis (which
     implementation or review comment it came from), and the related file paths
     clear. A later stage picks that heading up mechanically, so use exactly
     that string
   - **Do not edit `todo.md` directly.** In the develop flow, "out-of-scope
     issues go into `todo.md`" is satisfied via learnings.md; reflecting them
     into `todo.md` is the wrap-up phase's job
7. Run the local checks **against the final state** (so the plan.md /
   learnings.md updates are verified too, which means always after the Markdown
   updates):
   - Formatting: `mise run fmt`
   - Everything: `mise run ci`
   - `mise run ci` can take close to 10 minutes, so pass the maximum `timeout`
     of `600000` (ms) explicitly to the Bash tool (the default timeout
     can be as low as 120 s and would cut it off). **Do not set `run_in_background: true`** (a subagent exits the
     moment its turn ends, leaving nobody to receive the completion notice)
8. `git add` **only the files this step actually changed** (the implementation
   files + the whole relevant plan directory) by path, and `git commit`. Pass
   the plan directory as `docs/plans/YYYYMMDD-{feature-name}/` (listing only
   `plan.md` / `learnings.md` drops incidental files created during planning or
   implementation, such as `design-decisions.md` or extra research notes).
   `git add .` and `git add -A` are forbidden (they would pull untracked or
   unstaged changes unrelated to this step into the same commit)
   - Commit message: `{type}({scope}): {summary of the step}`

## When the local checks fail

Try fixing and re-running `mise run fmt` → `mise run ci` **at most 3 times**. If
it will not pass in 3, give up on solving it yourself, report to the caller in
the format below, and stop (without committing). Do not keep fixing forever.

Before re-running, separate an **environment** failure from an **implementation
mistake**.

Environmental (unrelated to your change; fixing the code will not help):

- A dependency is not installed
- The network is down (a registry or external API is unreachable)
- `mise` itself is failing because it cannot write its lock file
  (`mise ERROR Operation not permitted (os error 1) at path
  "~/.config/mise/.mise.lock"`). That is a sandbox write refusal, so re-run the
  same command once with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
- A clone of another repository under `tmp/` is being picked up by a check
- Only files you never touched are failing

When you judge it environmental, try the known remedy once. If that does not fix
it, give up and report before burning through the attempts. **Do not distort
your implementation to suit the environment.**

An implementation mistake (caused by a file you changed) you simply fix and
re-run. That re-run counts against the attempts.

When giving up, report:

- How many times you tried `mise run ci`
- The last error output (the gist; excerpt the relevant part if it is long)
- Whether you judged it environmental or an implementation mistake, and why
- What you tried along the way (if anything)
- The list of files left uncommitted in the working tree (including the
  implementation files and the additions to plan.md / learnings.md)

## Implementation policy

- No refactoring or drive-by fixes beyond the functional requirement
- Match the existing style
- Error handling only where it is needed
- As a rule, no comments (only where there is a non-obvious reason)

## Output

Report to the caller:

- Terminal state: `COMMITTED` (got through step 8) / `LOCAL_CHECK_FAILED` (tried
  the step 7 local checks 3 times and gave up)
- The step number completed
- The list of files changed
- The commit hash (`null` for `LOCAL_CHECK_FAILED`)
- Whether the acceptance criteria are met
- Where you appended to learnings.md, if anything (including whether and how
  many items you recorded under `## Deferred issues (todo candidates)`)
- For `LOCAL_CHECK_FAILED`, the give-up report format from "When the local
  checks fail" verbatim (attempts, last error output, the basis for calling it
  environmental or an implementation mistake, and what is left uncommitted)
