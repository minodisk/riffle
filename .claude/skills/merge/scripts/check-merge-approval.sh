# Decide, from a PR's changed paths, whether it may be auto-merged without user
# approval.
#
# The criterion is **"does a revert undo it?"** — not "does merging cause a side
# effect". A rebuild or redeploy is not cause for approval, because reverting a
# broken change takes the same path back to the previous state. Approval is
# required for what a revert does not undo:
#   (1) self-referential things (this judgement script itself, agent / skill /
#       permission definitions, CODEOWNERS, CI pipeline definitions — anything
#       that rewrites the approval gate itself)
#   (2) things that move external state irreversibly
#   (3) the toolchain and supply chain (mise.toml, Cargo.lock, cargo config,
#       hooks and editor settings that run automatically on a developer machine)
#   (4) build scripts that execute arbitrary code at build time
#
# The judgement is fail-closed.
#   1. Any path matching an approval pattern → approval required
#   2. Every path matching a safe pattern → auto-merge allowed
#   3. Any path matching neither → approval required (reason = unclassified)
# A deny-list alone would silently fall to the auto-merge side whenever a new
# directory appears.
#
# Output goes to stdout, one line per entry.
#   approval <path>: <reason>   matched an approval pattern
#   unclassified <path>         matched neither pattern
# The one exception is zero changed files, which prints a single special line
# `unclassified (no files): PR <pr> has zero changed files` (the path part is
# not a path).
# It ends with the tally line `TOTAL=<n> APPROVAL=<n> UNCLASSIFIED=<n> SAFE=<n>`.
#
# exit code:
#   0 = auto-merge allowed (every path is a safe pattern)
#   1 = approval required (an approval pattern matched, or a path is unclassified)
#   2 = bad arguments / an environment error such as a failed gh call
#
# With `--paths-from-stdin` it does not call gh and reads a newline-separated
# path list from stdin. The judgement, output, and exit code are identical to
# normal mode; only the input route is swapped (used by the test).
# The allow rules in `.claude/settings.json` pass arguments through regardless,
# so enabling it also requires the environment variable
# `CHECK_MERGE_APPROVAL_STDIN=1`. If a command-line argument alone could enable
# it, a path list unrelated to the real PR could be passed to fake the verdict.
#
# Call it by its relative path (the allow rules in `.claude/settings.json`
# assume `bash .claude/...`, so an absolute path produces a consent prompt).
