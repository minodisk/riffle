# Wait for GitHub Actions workflow runs triggered by a merge commit to complete.
#
# Usage:
#   wait-post-merge-runs.sh [--max-wait=<seconds>] <merge-commit-sha>
#
# Options:
#   --max-wait=<seconds>  Maximum wait. Takes precedence over MAX_WAIT
#
# Options via env:
#   POLL_INTERVAL   Seconds. Default 30
#   MAX_WAIT        Seconds. Default 1800 (30 minutes). Only used when --max-wait is absent.
#                   Agent callers pass --max-wait=240 and the Bash tool's
#                   `timeout: 600000` (ms), because the default foreground
#                   timeout can be as low as 120 s
#   INITIAL_GRACE   Seconds. Default 60 (waiting for runs to appear in the list)
#
# Behavior:
#   - Lists every run whose head is that commit with `gh run list --commit=<sha>`
#   - Polls until zero runs are queued / in_progress / waiting / requested /
#     pending (waiting includes waiting on an environment approval)
#   - Once all are completed, prints the results as a table, ending with
#     `STATUS=success|failed|timeout|no_runs`
#   - Exits 1 if even one run concluded failure / timed_out / startup_failure /
#     action_required / stale
#   - A run concluded canceled is treated as collateral from concurrency
#     (cancel-in-progress) when a newer successful run of the same workflow
#     exists on the default branch: it is not counted as a failure and shows as
#     `superseded` in the table. A canceled run with no later success is still
#     treated as a failure
#   - When the re-run is not yet complete, it withholds the verdict and keeps
#     polling (it starts seconds after the cancellation, so it is usually
#     incomplete at this point). But if there is a failure other than what it is
#     waiting on, STATUS will not change, so it exits 1 without waiting
#   - On a timeout while still awaiting a verdict, it still prints the table and
#     counts at that moment (with the pending canceled counted as a failure)
#   - If the gh call used for the superseded check fails, it warns on stderr and
#     leaves that run as canceled (i.e. a failure). The results table is always
#     printed
#   - Right after the table it prints TOTAL_COUNT / FAILED_COUNT (failures
#     excluding superseded; includes a canceled with no later success and a
#     canceled still awaiting a verdict) / SUPERSEDED_COUNT
#   - A timeout is exit 2
#   - no_runs (still zero after the initial grace) is exit 0 with STATUS=no_runs
#   - A failure of `gh run list` itself is exit 3. gh's error output is not
#     captured but passed through to this script's stderr, followed by one line
#     containing the SHA
#   - Bad arguments or options are exit 4
#
# Call it by its relative path (the allow rules in `.claude/settings.json`
# assume `bash .claude/...`, so an absolute path produces a consent prompt).
