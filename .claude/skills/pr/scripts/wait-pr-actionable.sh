# Poll until the PR reaches a state that needs the agent's judgement, then
# return pr-status.sh's output at that moment verbatim.
#
# The waiting ACTIONs in the pr skill's step 5 (`wait` = checks in progress /
# `review_required` = waiting on the approver) give the agent nothing to decide
# on. Driving them agent-side with `until ...; do sleep 30; done` makes a
# compound command that prompts every time, so the wait loop is shut inside this
# script as one atomic call.
#
# The ACTIONs that end the wait and return:
#   ready / merged / closed / conflict / check_failed / changes_requested /
#   draft / behind / blocked
#
# The default max_wait_sec is 240 (4 minutes). The Bash tool's default
# foreground timeout can be as low as 120 s, so callers must pass the Bash
# tool's `timeout: 600000` (ms) explicitly; 600 s is the maximum. Keep the wait
# shorter than that to always land on "the script returns exit 2 itself" (killed
# by the tool, the exit code is unobservable and cannot be branched on).
# max_wait_sec is the sum of the sleeps; real time adds pr-status.sh's runtime
# on top (a few seconds per call × the number of waits). At 240 it measures out
# around 5 minutes, well under 600 s.
# To wait longer, callers extend the wait by re-running and counting exit 2, not
# by backgrounding.
#
# usage: wait-pr-actionable.sh <PR_number_or_url> [interval_sec=30] [max_wait_sec=240]
# exit code:
#   0 = reached a non-waiting ACTION (branch on the ACTION= line in the output)
#   1 = error (bad arguments / pr-status.sh failed)
#   2 = timeout (prints the last observed state to stdout; calling again is fine)
