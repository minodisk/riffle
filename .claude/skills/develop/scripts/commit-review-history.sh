# Commit and push the local review history (the develop skill's local review
# rounds).
#
# Writing a branch like `if ! git diff --cached --quiet; then ... fi`
# agent-side makes a compound command that prompts every time, so the judgment
# is shut inside this script as one atomic call.
#
# This script never writes the index itself (`git status --porcelain` takes an
# optional lock, `git push` does not touch the index). Index writes go through
# commit-push.sh, which also owns waiting on and reclaiming index.lock.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Confirm the review history directory exists (its absence is a caller
#      error, e.g. a typo in the branch name; this prevents the accident of
#      treating it as "no diff" and only pushing)
#   2. Guarantee the index is empty (leftover staged changes contradict
#      commit-push.sh's premise, so fail explicitly)
#   3. If the target directory has a diff (untracked included), commit and push
#      with commit-push.sh (which runs mise run fmt → mise run ci before pushing)
#   4. With no diff, push only (the case where the preceding Address phase
#      already committed and pushed. A new branch may have no upstream, so push
#      with the same judgment commit-push.sh uses)
#
# Sandbox: this script assumes it is always called with the Bash tool's
# `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. Setting an upstream writes to the shared
# `.git/config`, which under the sandbox always fails with
# `could not lock config file ...: Operation not permitted` (measured).
#
# usage: commit-review-history.sh <branch-name>
# exit code:
#   0 = ok
#   1 = review history directory missing / leftover staged changes / a sub-command failed
#   2 = bad arguments
