# Format and verify the whole repository, then stage only the given paths,
# commit with the message, and push.
# With no upstream set, it pushes with -u origin <current-branch>.
#
# Sandbox: this script assumes it is always called with the Bash tool's
# `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. Setting an upstream writes to the shared
# `.git/config`, which under the sandbox always fails with
# `could not lock config file ...: Operation not permitted` (measured).
#
# Always run `mise run fmt` → `mise run ci` before pushing. Both run over the
# whole repository with no arguments. Only the <path>... given as arguments go
# into the commit (`git add "$@"`), so a file formatted outside that set just
# stays in the working tree uncommitted. This assumes it is called with an empty
# index (no staged changes), so it fails if there are any (the guard below).
# Pushing unformatted Markdown on the first push makes the fmt CI fail after PR
# creation, forcing a follow-up formatting push — and then the automated review
# has run against the first push (an older head) and the head counts as
# unreviewed. Running fmt here every time keeps the head from drifting.
