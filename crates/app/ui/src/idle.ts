// Holds an operation pressed while `busy` (a scan runs) until `drain` is

// one, firing its `cancel` (as `discard` does; `drain` only runs it).
// `enterInFlight`/`leaveInFlight` are called by the caller from
// dispatch until the operation settles, so a rescan can queue behind it. A
// count rather than a flag, since two deferred operations can overlap (for
// example a strip rename confirmed while a folder rename's reopen chain is
// still pending): the first to settle must not clear the flag out from
// under the other.
