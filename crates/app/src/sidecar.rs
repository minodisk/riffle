//! The single writer thread that turns judgments into sidecars, in the
//! format selected by the `sidecarFormat` setting (XMP, DxO PhotoLab `.dop`,
//! or both).
//!
//! A keypress must never wait on disk, so `set_rating` only writes the
//! `ratings` row and hands the judgment to this thread. Entries are
//! coalesced per path with a trailing debounce — mashing `1`, `2`, `3` on one
//! file writes the sidecar once, with `3` — and each write goes to a temp file
//! that is fsynced and renamed over the sidecar, so a crash mid-write leaves
//! the previous sidecar intact rather than a truncated one.
//!
//! Nothing here is async: the thread blocks on `recv_timeout` against the
//! earliest deadline, which makes the drain on quit a plain synchronous
//! handshake.
