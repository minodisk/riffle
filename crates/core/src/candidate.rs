//! The focus candidate cue: how likely the eyes of the face nearest the AF
//! point are in focus, and whether that clears `CANDIDATE_LOGIT`.
//!
//! The score combines two measures over each eye's region of the face mesh
//! (`eyes::mesh_of`): the Laplacian variance of the luma (`lap`) and the
//! mean edge width (`edge_width`) relative to the region's longer side, in a
//! logistic regression fitted on hand-labeled frames (`MESH_LOGIT_*`); the
//! sharper eye's logit is the frame's. When no eye region counts (no mesh,
//! or regions under `EYE_REGION_MIN` or without an edge width) the same two
//! measures over a window between the eyes are scored with the window model
//! (`LOGIT_*`). Its sigmoid is the in-focus probability. The mesh runs only
//! on a face whose box long side is at least `eyes::EYES_MIN_FACE`
//! (`meshes_face`): a smaller face goes straight to the window, as no eye
//! region of one under 58 px counted on the labeled frames.
//!
//! Faces come from `faces::detect_around_rgb` in a `CATCH_CROP` square around
//! the trusted AF point. A Sony eye-AF frame gets the same detection: the
//! camera tracking a face does not say whether that face is sharp. Without a
//! trusted AF point, `scan` judges the largest confident face of the whole
//! preview (`eyes::judged_face`) through `face_cue_unless`.
//! Everything is in the preview's stored (unrotated) coordinates.
