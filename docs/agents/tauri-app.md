# Working on `crates/app`

Read this before touching Tauri commands, `crates/app/tauri.conf.json`, or the
`crates/app/ui/` frontend. It lists the pitfalls this repository has already
hit, each with the reason it happens.

Each item is tagged:

- **Hit**: actually broke something here.
- **Inferred**: taken from the sources or docs; nothing has broken on it yet.

Source: `docs/plans/_archived/20260917-tauri-skeleton/learnings.md` and the fix
in #11.

## Rust side

### Synchronous commands run on the main thread (Hit)

A `#[tauri::command]` without `async` runs **inline on the main thread**.

- Why: tauri-macros routes non-`async` commands through `body_blocking`, which
  calls the function directly from the IPC handler instead of spawning it.
- What broke: `pick_folder` called `blocking_pick_folder`, which parks the
  calling thread on a `sync_channel(0)` `recv`. The main thread stopped pumping
  the run loop, so the native dialog appeared but its buttons did nothing and
  the app hung.
- This passed `mise run ci`, `tsc --noEmit`, and local review.
  It surfaced the first time the user launched the app. An earlier learnings
  note claimed sync commands run off the main thread; that note was wrong.

Rules:

- Anything that waits (dialogs, channels, locks held by the UI) goes in an
  `async` command. For callback APIs, await a
  `tauri::async_runtime::channel(1)`; see `pick_folder` in
  `crates/app/src/commands.rs`.
- An `async` command doing blocking IO wraps it in
  `tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking`, as `preview` does. Why: blocking
  inside the future stalls an async runtime worker instead.

### `frontendDist` resolves from the `tauri.conf.json` directory (Hit)

`tauri.conf.json` lives in `crates/app/`, not the conventional `src-tauri/`, so
the sibling `ui/` is `"frontendDist": "ui"`.

- Why: Tauri resolves the path relative to the directory holding
  `tauri.conf.json`.
- What broke: the plan's `"../ui"` pointed at `crates/ui`, and
  `tauri::generate_context!()` failed the build because the path did not exist.

## Frontend (`crates/app/ui`, `tsc` only, no bundler)

### `tsc` rejects `outDir` equal to `rootDir` (Hit)

To emit `.js` next to the `.ts` sources, omit both options.

- Why: the `outDir` is auto-excluded from inputs, which leaves none (TS18003).

### A `.ts` file with no `import`/`export` is a global script (Hit)

Its top-level `const`/`let` share scope with `lib.dom` globals; `const status`
collided with `window.status`. Add an `import` or `export` (`main.ts` ends with
`export {};`).

- Why: TypeScript only treats a file as a module when it has a top-level
  `import` or `export`.

### Workers: declare the scope locally (Hit)

`worker.ts` declares the members it uses as a local `WorkerScope` interface and
casts `self` to it. Keep one `tsconfig.json` for both threads this way.

- Why: `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope` is only in the `webworker` lib, and adding
  `webworker` next to `dom` clashes on the globals both declare.

### Write relative imports with `.js` (Inferred)

`import { x } from "./foo.js"`, never `"./foo"`.

- Why: `moduleResolution: "bundler"` type-checks extensionless imports, but no
  bundler rewrites them, so the webview requests `./foo` and gets a 404 at
  runtime, after type-checking has passed.
- Nothing enforces this; today the frontend has no relative imports at all.

## CI

### Do not hard-code the pnpm store path (Inferred)

Cache the output of `pnpm store path --silent` (see `.github/workflows/`).

- Why: the store location differs per OS.

## Verification

### GUI automation does not work on this Mac (Hit)

`osascript` is denied assistive access: the app's window cannot be brought
forward, and injected keystrokes are dropped silently.

- Why: macOS privacy settings on this machine, not something the repo controls.
- Plan any GUI check as a **manual confirmation by the user**, and list exactly
  what they should look at. Report unchecked behaviour as "not verified"; that
  is more useful than an implied pass.
